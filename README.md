<h1 style="text-align: center">Cat Todo</h1>

<p>
    This project was made using React, SASS and the resources of Next.js. I was using this project for learning React, seeing documentation of React and Next.js. To acess this project deployed on vercel click right here

<h3>Clone the project</h3>

```git
git clone https://github.com/Renatouhu/cat-todo.git
```

<h3>Final Considerations</h3>
<p>Cat todo was a project circa 3 months to be made, i used this project to learn more about React and Next.js, that i'm choosed to start my career was web developer. cat todo was a project that a learned a lot and have fun with, i really hope to go forward in my career.
<br>
    My idea first of all, was to make a project using almost zero libraries (exception <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid">uuid</a> to create random id). i know that is just the beginning into the universe of frameworks and libraries, have some bugs on project and some features that i want to fix and add in some point in future, but for now this is it
